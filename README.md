# Flood_prediction
• Developed an early flood prediction system using LightGBM machine learning algorithm, focusing on
data collection, model implementation, performance evaluation, and interface development.
• Utilized key libraries including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow Keras Utils,
Imbalanced-learn, and Scikit-learn for comprehensive data manipulation, visualization, and model
evaluation.
• Demonstrated the practical application of the model in aiding emergency response teams with early
detection, risk assessment, and decision-making processes.
